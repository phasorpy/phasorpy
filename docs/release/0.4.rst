PhasorPy 0.4 (2025-01-30)
=========================

This is the fourth alpha release of the PhasorPy library.
It contains several bug fixes and many improvements, mostly to the
``phasorpy.io`` module.
File reader functions are now named ``signal_from_*`` or ``phasor_from_*``
and have a more consistent API.
Point mode PTU files, LIF files containing phasor coordinates or hyperspectral
signals, and FLIM LABS JSON files are supported.
PhasorPy releases are now available on conda-forge.

This release supports Python 3.10 to 3.13.
