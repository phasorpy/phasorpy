PhasorPy 0.5 (2025-04-11)
=========================

This is the fifth alpha release of the PhasorPy library.
It contains several bug fixes and improvements.
The new ``phasor_cluster_gmm`` function finds clusters in phasor coordinates
using a Gaussian mixture model.
The ``phasor_filter_pawflim`` function applies a wavelet filter using the
pawFLIM library.

This release supports Python 3.11 to 3.13. Python 3.10 is no longer supported.
