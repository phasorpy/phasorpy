PhasorPy 0.8 (2025-10-10)
=========================

This is the eighth alpha release of the PhasorPy library.
It contains several improvements and breaking changes.

Filter-related functions have moved from the ``phasor`` module to
the new ``filter`` module.
A new ``filter.signal_filter_ncpca`` function has been added that
filters signals using noise-corrected principal component analysis.
The ``experimental.spectral_vector_denoise`` function has been
renamed to ``filter.signal_filter_svd``.

The ``io.signal_from_fbd`` function has been updated to use
the ``fbdfile`` package.

This release supports Python 3.12 to 3.14. Python 3.11 is no longer supported.
