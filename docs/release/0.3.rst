PhasorPy 0.3 (2024-12-16)
=========================

This is the third alpha release of the PhasorPy library.
It fixes the averaging of phasor coordinates in the ``phasor_center`` and
``phasor_calibrate`` functions, replaces the ``phasor_filter`` function
with ``phasor_filter_median``, adds support for multiple harmonics to
``phasor_threshold``, and adds the ``read_imspector_tiff`` function to read
ImSpector FLIM TIFF files.

This release supports Python 3.10 to 3.13.
