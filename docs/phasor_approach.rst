Phasor approach
===============

“The phasor approach to fluorescence lifetime imaging, and more recently
hyperspectral fluorescence imaging, has increased the use of these
techniques, and improved the ease and intuitiveness of the data analysis.
The fit-free nature of the phasor plots increases the speed of the analysis
and reduces the dimensionality, optimization of data handling and storage.
The reciprocity principle between the real and imaginary space—where the
phasor and the pixel that the phasor originated from are linked and can be
converted from one another—has helped the expansion of this method.
The phasor coordinates calculated from a pixel, where multiple fluorescent
species are present, depends on the phasor positions of those components.
The relative positions are governed by the linear combination properties of
the phasor space. According to this principle, the phasor position of a
pixel with multiple components lies inside the polygon whose vertices are
occupied by the phasor positions of these individual components and the
distance between the image phasor to any of the vertices is inversely
proportional to the fractional intensity contribution of that component to
the total fluorescence from that image pixel.
The higher the fractional intensity contribution of a vertex, the closer is
the resultant phasor. The linear additivity in the phasor space can be
exploited to obtain the fractional intensity contribution from multiple
species and quantify their contribution.”
