The PhasorPy project is jointly maintained by the
`Advanced Bioimaging Unit <https://pasteur.uy/en/units/advanced-bioimaging>`_
at the University of the Republic and Institut Pasteur de Montevideo and the
`Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics <https://www.lfd.uci.edu>`_
at the University of California, Irvine.

The development of the PhasorPy library is supported by the
`Chan Zuckerberg Initiative
<https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/phasorpy-a-python-library-for-phasor-analysis-of-flim-and-spectral-imaging/>`_.

PhasorPy was inspired by the
`Globals for Images · SimFCS <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/globals/>`_ software by
Enrico Gratton.
