The PhasorPy project is jointly maintained by the
`Advanced Bioimaging Unit <https://pasteur.uy/en/units/advanced-bioimaging>`_
at the University of the Republic and Institut Pasteur de Montevideo and the
`Laboratory for Fluorescence Dynamics <https://www.lfd.uci.edu>`_
at the University of California, Irvine.

The development of the PhasorPy library is supported by the
`Chan Zuckerberg Initiative
