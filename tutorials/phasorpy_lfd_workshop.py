LFD Workshop FLIM Tutorial
==========================

The LFD Workshop FLIM tutorial adapted to PhasorPy.

This tutorial is a close adaptation of the
`LFD Workshop computer training tutorial - FLIM section
<https://www.lfd.uci.edu/workshop/2021/files/LFDWorkshop2021-ComputerTraining.pdf>`_
(by E. Gratton, M. Digman, and J. Unruh)
using the PhasorPy library instead of the
`Globals for Images Â· SimFCS <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/globals/>`_
and Excel software.

.. note::

    This tutorial is work in progress. Not all of SimFCS' functionality is
    available in the PhasorPy library yet.

# Phasor properties
# -----------------
#
# The phasor is a frequency domain representation of the fluorescence
# lifetime at a single frequency. For single exponential lifetimes, this
# completely describes the system.
# For multiple exponentials, the phasor represents some intensity weighted
# linear combination of the lifetimes in the system. Therefore, given the
# phasor for a single multiexponential measurement, we cannot determine
# the lifetimes for the system.
# Nevertheless, given multiple measurements (e.g. multiple pixels in an
# image), heterogeneity becomes obvious.
#
# To demonstrate this effect, calculate:
#
# - the phasor at a single frequency for a combination of four exponentials:

frequency = 80.0  # MHz
lifetimes = [4.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5]  # ns
amplitudes = [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]  # pre-exponential amplitudes

phasor_single = phasor_from_lifetime(frequency, lifetimes)

    frequency, lifetimes, amplitudes, preexponential=True

    )
)

signal, instrument_response, times = lifetime_to_signal(
    frequency, lifetimes, amplitudes, preexponential=True, samples=256
)

# %%
# Two state equilibrium
# ---------------------
#
# Fluorescent ion indicators often exist in two distinct states with
# different emission spectra and fluorescence lifetimes (and sometimes
# absorption spectra). The lifetime may be multiexponential in both the
# free and ion-bound state. Binding to the ion of interest shifts the
# equilibrium between these states, changing the spectral properties
# and the fluorescence lifetimes. Therefore, the free and bound states
# will be characterized by different "phasors". Close to the dissociation
# constant, the fluorescence lifetime is characterized by a linear
# combination of the two phasors.
#
# Simulate the phasor for different combinations (relative amplitudes)
# of a 4 ns lifetime state and a 1 ns lifetime state
# (e.g. amplitude 1 = 0.2, amplitude 2 = 0.8).

frequency = 80.0  # MHz
lifetimes = [4.0, 1.0]  # ns
amplitudes_list = [[1.0, 0.0], [0.8, 0.2], [0.5, 0.5], [0.2, 0.8], [0.0, 1.0]]

# Questions:
#
# - When half of the population is in the 1 ns state, has the phasor moved
#   halfway between the phasors for the two states?
# - Does the position of the phasor change linearly with concentration?
# - What about with fractional intensity?
# - What information is needed to calculate concentration
#   from the position of a phasor?

# Capillaries

# The file, ``capillaries1001.ref``, contains phase and modulation data on
# three capillaries filled with different dye solutions.
# The extension ``.ref``, for referenced, indicates that this file has been
# corrected for phase shifts and detection efficiency relative to a reference
# with a known lifetime (e.g., Fluorescein).

# display the images, and plot the phasor coordinates of first and second

# Quenching, FRET
# ---------------
#
# This section will discuss quenching due to FRET. The efficiency
# of energy transfer is related to the fluorescence lifetime as follows:
#
# .. math::
#
#     E &= 1 - \frac{\tau_{D}}{\tau_{DA}}
#
#     \tau_{DA} &= \tau_{D} (1 - E)
#
# where :math:`\tau_{DA}` is the lifetime of the donor in the presence of
# acceptor (quenched) and :math:`\tau_{D}` is the lifetime of the donor
# in the absence of acceptor.
#
# Calculate the phasor for a fluorophore with a 4 ns lifetime.
# Then calculate its phasor under different efficiencies of energy transfer.
# How does this differ from what we saw with the two-state system?

# %%
# If only the donor fluorophore is excited (no direct excitation of the
# acceptor), the acceptor fluorescence shows a very unusual phenomenon.
# The fluorescence of the acceptor rises with the same time constant as
# the quenched donor fluorescence.
# Then it decays with the characteristic lifetime of the acceptor.
# For example, when the donor lifetime has been quenched to 0.5 ns
# and the acceptor lifetime is 4 ns, the acceptor can be simulated
# by a lifetime of 0.5 ns with amplitude of -1 and a lifetime of 4 ns with
# amplitude of 1:
